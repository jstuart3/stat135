##Lab 2: Who Plays Video Games?
####Week 2

We look at the problem of estimating the average amount of time students in the class spent playing video games in the week prior to the survey. Instead of interviewing the entire class, we will interview a subset of the class, then develop an approximation for the full group, based on the information from the gathered from the subset. 

####Vocabulary
**Population**  
*Population units*  
*Population size*  
*Unit characteristic*  
*Population parameter*  

**Sample**  
*Sample units*  
*Sample size*  
*Sample statistic* 


*Selection rule*  
*Finite population correction factor*  
*Standard errors*


####The Probability Model
The *simple random sample* method puts a probability structure on the sample. The *sample statistic* has a probability distribution related to the sampling procedure. 


####Results to Reproduce
$E(x_i)=\mu$  

$E(\bar{x})=\mu$  

$Var(X_i)=\sigma^2$  

$Cov(X_i, X_j)=\frac{-\sigma^2}{(N-1)}$  

$Var(\bar{x})=\frac{\sigma^2}{n}\frac{N-n}{N-1}$  

$SD(\bar{x})=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{\sqrt{N-n}}{\sqrt{N-1}}$
